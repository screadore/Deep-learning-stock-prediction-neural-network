Goal: To predict stock prices based off of Yahoo stock charts and data using Python. The code implements a deep learning algorithm, neural network, and price predictions.

Downside: The algorithm is accurate for prices within a specific range, but doesn't take into account public influence or social media influence therefore, shows to be a poor
predictor when it comes to large single day price swings.
